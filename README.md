🌐 Simple WebSocket is an HTML based project, using PIXI.js library to create a simple WebSocket server and client.

## Functions
💻 The project just draws a rectangle inside an canvas, but is a nice start to anyone that wants to learn how to use websockets.

- Total of 3 servers (main server, express server & websocket server)
- Compatibility with Localtunnel (package already built in)
- Mobile support (tested on chrome on android 10)

## Using

### Without Localtunnel

```javascript
yarn dev
```

### With Localtunnel

```javascript
yarn dev

lt --port 80
lt --port 3000
```

🚧 Using Localtunnel you must access game site using HTTP, and set url in config.js file at:

```javascript
public/assets/js/game/etc/config.js
```

Replace empty field with your Localtunnel port 3000 url.
